DESCRIPTION
This is a simple but helpful web app built with Flask that guides users in choosing the right solar panel system for their home or business. It takes into account how much energy you use, sunlight data for your location, and available solar panel options. It even breaks down the cost, shows your return on investment, and gives you a visual idea of how the panels would be laid out.
